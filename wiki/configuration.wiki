= Application configuration based on OTP environment variables =

currently the following OTP environment variables can be configured:
  * flv_dir (default location of video files for playback)

how it works:
  * there is a OTP .app file template in the src folder (ems.app.src)
  * the first time you compile, it gets copied into ebin folder
  * there you can customize it, it won't get overwritten.


== differnt configurations for different environments ==

for different environments such as staging, testing the OTP environment variables can be overwritten at VM start.

Example: startscript

{{{
#!/bin/sh

ERL=erl
NODENAME=ems
FLV_DIR=/path/to/flv/dir

$ERL -pa `pwd`/ebin \
   -boot start_sasl -config config/error_log \
   -s ems \
   -sname $NODENAME \
   -ems flv_die "\"${FLV_DIR}\"" \
   -heart \
   -noinput &
