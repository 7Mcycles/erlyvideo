#summary To Do list for erlyVideo / Erlang Media Server

= Introduction =

This ia a quick and dirty ToDo list.


== Overview ==

Main Points
 * FLV Playback
 * FLV Recording
 * Live Streams
 * distributed live streams

lesser issues
 * Add specific folder support into gen_rtmp applications for playing and recording. Do this with user config file

== Details ==


=== Stuart's current Items ===

 * check if ems_amf:numer_to_string/1 is used outside of ems_amf
 * split ems_app into ems_app and ems_sup
 * separate encode/decoud routines into separate modules

=== Roberto's current items ===
 * *URGENT:* make the per-connection id creation work 
 * fix audio recording
 * fix live streaming
 * use relative timestamp (needs rewrite of channel creation code)
 * major main-FSM refactoring, now it is just a mess of code
 * add distributed media broker (getting media from Cache, filesystem, network filesystem, S3, etc ..
 * replace mnesia hack with Stuarts well thought approach

cosmetics:
 * make this warning go away: src/ems_demo.erl:38: Warning: behaviour gen_rtmp undefined (two step compilation or just surpressing it in Emakefile)
